## history so far
I've moved countries back and forth a couple of times, also jobs, girlfriends, socks, the list goes on...
As I take my flight next Wednesday (to yet another country) all I can think of is how my future work
will be, and how it will affect me/my life. Also Ikea sofabeds prices.

## great expectations
I come from a long and proud lineage of high-expectation gentlemen. So watching @mujombo's
[github talk](http://speakerdeck.com/u/mojombo/p/optimizing-for-happiness) probably wasn't this month's
best idea. Still, go watch it, and see how to build a dream.
