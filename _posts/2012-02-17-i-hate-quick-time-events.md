Who in the seven hells thought that this would EVER be a good idea ?

I bet it went like this "DUDE I got this amazing idea! Let's force players to smash random 
buttons whenever they least expect it! It's pure genious, they won't be able to focus on the ACTUAL 
gameplay, saving us the trouble of writing a proper game, they also won't be able to watch the 
cutscenes, the boys down at the studio will loves us for saving their skin, oh oh! and we can just 
crank up the speed and voil√° we have ourselves difficulty settings! Fuck me I'm brilliant".

So thank you Final Fantasy 13-2 for reflaming my hatred for quick time events... Asura's Wrath I am 
looking at you too.

ps: And wtf with the "13-2" ? Some biblical thing ? Numerology ?
